I am pleased to announce the completion of our capstone project for our 2nd year, 2nd semester in the Department of Computing at the Faculty of Computing, E-Tickz, a groundbreaking solution for enhancing the experience of depot bus services. Traditional methods of using physical season tickets have posed several challenges, from the inconvenience of lost cards to environmental concerns with paper tickets. Our app is designed to address these issues by introducing digital season tickets through QR codes.

One of the main problems faced by passengers using depot bus services is the hassle of carrying and managing physical season tickets. These cards can easily get lost or damaged, causing inconvenience during ticket inspections and boarding. Moreover, the environmental impact of paper tickets raises sustainability concerns in today's world.

With E-Tickz, passengers can now enjoy the convenience of digital season tickets, eliminating the need for physical cards. By generating a QR code within the app, users can easily access their ticket whenever they board a bus. This digital solution not only enhances convenience but also contributes to a greener environment by reducing paper waste.

Key features of our mobile application include seamless issuance of digital season tickets, easy validation through QR codes during bus trips, and the ability to track usage history within the app. This streamlined process not only benefits passengers but also improves efficiency for conductors during ticket inspections.

The benefits for users are manifold. They can carry their ticket securely on their phone, ensuring accessibility and peace of mind. The faster boarding process with digital validation saves time for both passengers and conductors, enhancing overall efficiency. Moreover, embracing digital ticketing solutions aligns with sustainability goals, making a positive impact on the environment.
